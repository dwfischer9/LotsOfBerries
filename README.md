## LotsOfBerries 

My first minecraft mod, Lots of Berries adds many new varieties of berries in most biomes, including the Nether and The End!
Crafting recipies will be coming soon, and I have plans to add a new block, the juicer which allows you to extract juice from berries and combine their effects
into potion-like items! 

Curseforge link will be here when completed.
